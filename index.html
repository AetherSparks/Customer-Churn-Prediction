            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Customer Churn Prediction Model</strong> is a data science project developed to predict the likelihood of a customer canceling their subscription (churning) with a telecommunications company. By using machine learning techniques such as <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> and <strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong>, the model analyzes various customer features to predict churn. The project helps to identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling companies to implement retention strategies to minimize churn.</p>
            <p>This project relies heavily on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which includes customer data such as their demographics, account information, and usage patterns. Through rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning, the goal is to achieve high accuracy and precision in the churn predictions.</p>

            <!-- Dataset -->
            <div class="outline-item">
                <h3>2. Dataset Used</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Telco Customer Churn dataset</strong> is publicly available and contains information about the customers of a telecommunications company. The dataset has 7,043 customer records and 21 features, including both categorical and numerical variables. Some of the key features in the dataset include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>gender</strong>: The gender of the customer (Male or Female).</li>
                    <li><strong>tenure</strong>: The number of months the customer has been subscribed to the company.</li>
                    <li><strong>monthlycharges</strong>: The monthly charge for the customer’s service.</li>
                    <li><strong>totalcharges</strong>: The total amount spent by the customer over the course of their subscription.</li>
                    <li><strong>contract</strong>: The type of contract the customer has (Month-to-Month, One Year, or Two Year).</li>
                    <li><strong>paymentmethod</strong>: The method of payment used by the customer (e.g., Electronic Check, Mailed Check).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The target variable is <strong>Churn</strong>, which indicates whether the customer has left the company (1) or stayed (0). The dataset is balanced with a reasonable mix of churn and non-churn customers.</p>

            <!-- Model Training and Evaluation -->
            <div class="outline-item">
                <h3>3. Model Training and Evaluation</h3>
                <p>Once the data was preprocessed, the next step was training several machine learning models to predict customer churn. The following models were implemented and evaluated:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Logistic Regression</strong>: A statistical model used as a baseline for comparison with more complex models.</li>
                    <li><strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong>: A powerful ensemble method that constructs a series of decision trees and aggregates their predictions for improved accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>XGBoost</strong>: A gradient boosting algorithm that is known for its high performance on tabular data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After training the models, they were evaluated using the following metrics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precision</strong>: The ratio of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recall</strong>: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.</li>
                    <li><strong>F1 Score</strong>: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, which balances both metrics.</li>
                    <li><strong>ROC-AUC Curve</strong>: A graphical representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance, with a strong balance of precision, recall, and accuracy, making it the best model for this task.</p>

            <div class="outline-item">
                <h3>4. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering</h3>
                <p>Data preprocessing is a critical step in machine learning workflows. In this project, the following preprocessing steps were undertaken:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Missing Data Handling</strong>: Missing values were imputed using appropriate strategies, ensuring the dataset was complete for model training.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Scaling</strong>: Numerical features like <strong>monthlycharges</strong> and <strong>tenure</strong> were scaled to standardize their range, improving the performance of certain models like Logistic Regression.</li>
                    <li><strong>One-Hot Encoding</strong>: Categorical variables such as <strong>contract</strong>, <strong>paymentmethod</strong>, and <strong>gender</strong> were converted into dummy variables to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Creation</strong>: New features like <strong>customer_age</strong> (calculated from tenure) were engineered to provide more context for the models.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring that the models could learn the relationships between features effectively and make accurate predictions.</p>
